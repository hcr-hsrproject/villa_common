# tri_training_pushup_coach_scripts
The python scripts used for the mini hackathon pushup coach demo. The purpose of this demo is to show a minimalstic example usage of the navigation and speech synthesis python API.

1. Power on the robot using the procedure described in the documentation
2. Set the robot directly in front of the user doing the push ups
3. Ensure that the robot can navigate to (x,y) = (0.5, 0.5) and x = (-0.5, 0.5) from the robot's starting position in meters.

Launch both python scripts. Since no timing or handshaking was programmed, the robot may say or do silly things.
